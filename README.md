This work would have not been possible without:

**a-** this awesome lesson by Phil Freeman: 
  * talk -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtGECfksds
  * Slides -> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jMEqCYwQPW0lkLTk2o1aIkS27HSS5rG8KJaGyCfolos/edit#slide=id.p

**b-** this magistral implementation in purescript (thanks to all its contibutors):
  * https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-profunctor-lenses
  * https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-profunctor

Here the main goal is to learn profunctors and its derivatives (Strong, Choice,...) using a simple implementation of optic 'structures' (Lens, Prism, Getter, Fold,...) as a real use case.
